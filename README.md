# Window-automation-using-Rain-drop-sensor
🌧️ Window Automation System Using Rain Sensor.This project demonstrates an automated window control system using a rain sensor, servo motor, and an FPGA (Edge Artix-7). When rain is detected, the system triggers the servo motor to close the window, preventing water from entering. An led indicator provides visual feedback on rain detection.
